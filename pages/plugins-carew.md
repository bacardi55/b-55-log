As you may know, I'm using [carew]("http://carew.github.io") to manage this blog (a static blog / website generator). Unfortunatly, [carew]("http://carew.github.io/") is quite new and doesn't have as much plugins as [octopress](http://octopress.org) (a python static website generator).

I decided to start creating plugins for carew in order to help me manage this website. My plugins will be listed on this page.

As a reminder, the official [carew plugin list can be found here](http://carew.github.io/plugins.html)

Homemade plugins:

- [BlogRoll](/plugins-carew-blogroll.html): a simple list of links;
- [FastNav](/plugins-carew-fastnav.html): add link to the next / previous blog post.
- [TagList](/plugins-carew-taglist.html): Create a list of tags used in your blog post.

That's it for now, I'll try to create new one soon :)

*PS:* This plugin are working on the 2.x branch of carew and are no longer working with 1.x branch.
