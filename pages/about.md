About me
-----

Hi, I'm bacardi55 (also known in real life as Raphaël Khaïat), a french PHP developer. 

I work as a PHP lead developer in a big french company.

This blog is about my computer science passion (as everyon else^^)

I will mostly talk about these stuff:

- [PHP](http://php.net "php"): My favorite coding language.
- [Vim](http://vim.org "vim"): The best editor ever (no troll intended :p).
- [Symfony](http://symfony.com "symfony"): My favorite framework.
- [Silex](http://silex.sensio.org "silex"): A php micro framework based on the symfony2 components.
- [Drupal](http://drupal.org "drupal"): The most used php cms. 
- [i3](http://i3wm.org "i3"): My favorite window manager. It's a tiling window manager that is very powerfull :).
- [Archlinux](http://archlinux.org "archlinux"): My current OS (for 3 years now).
