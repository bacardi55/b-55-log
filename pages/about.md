# About Myself
Hi, I'm bacardi55 (also known in real life as Raphaël Khaïat), a french PHP developer.

I work as a PHP lead developer in a big french company.

This blog is about my computer science passion (as everyon else^^)

I will mostly talk about these stuff:

- [PHP](http://php.net "php"): My favorite coding language.
- [Vim](http://vim.org "vim"): The best editor ever (no troll intended :p).
- [Symfony](http://symfony.com "symfony"): My favorite framework.
- [Silex](http://silex.sensio.org "silex"): A php micro framework based on the symfony2 components.
- [Drupal](http://drupal.org "drupal"): The most used php cms.
- [i3](http://i3wm.org "i3"): My favorite window manager. It's a tiling window manager that is very powerfull :).
- [Archlinux](http://archlinux.org "archlinux"): My current OS (for 3 years now).

# About this Blog
This blog is generetaed by [Carew](http://carew.github.com "Carew"). It is a static blog generator like [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll") but written in php. It means that I write my articles in plain text in markdown format (like on github) and then I build my static site and push the file on the server. It means that my blog will be on git ([gitlab](https://lab.bacardi55.org "gitlab") and [github](http://github.com/bacardi55 "github")) and will be open sourced (what else©®).

It could be strange to want to use a static site in 2013 when everything is dynamic. But I don't feel that my little blog is a place where there will be a lot of comments… This blog will be about stuff that I don't want to forget, about my laptop configuration that I like on my daily use and of course about coding. I intend to write article about my new dev but also about some php toughts and new php features.

I really think it will help myself improve and stay keep up with all the exciting news in the web development! Hope many of you will enjoy them as well.

Why in english this time?
-------------------------
I wanted for a long time to have a blog in english. As I'm french, I thought about writting my blog posts both in english and french. But I realized I was way too lazy to do that ^^. So I thought about doing one in english.

As I started 2013 by coding a lot at home, I thought this was the time to start this new blog by trying carew :).
