## Jocs and Pocs are in 0.1-beta!

Hello everyone! I finally found the time to open the source code of my very early version of an open source [disqus](http://disqus.com). You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/bacardi55/jocs).

This is an early version which doesn't have a lot of features yet. I prefer the «release often, release early». If I don't do that, I'll never do it ^^.
Anyway, the system is currently use on this blog that is linked to php backend that I've developed in parallel as jocs. Its name is Pocs and you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/bacardi55/pocs).

I intend to continue to develop it at least until it is fully usable. For now, it's too early except if you like testing :).

The todo lists are on the readme of each github. Feel free to add your request on the github trackers.

No need for a long blog post for this, I'll create other blog posts to keep you posted.

PS: I open the comment system now even though there isn't a antispam yet. In case of trouble I might need to remove it until I add one… I like taking risks by using the app now :).
