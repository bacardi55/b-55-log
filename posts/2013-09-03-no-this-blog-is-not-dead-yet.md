## I'm not starting a new blog!

For those who was reading my 2 previous blog, each time I stopped publishing article for a while, I started a fresh blog to motivate me…
But don't worry, this is not the case this time !



## Ok, so ?

I know it has been a long time since I wrote something here… But I was working my ass off for a project that was really in deep sh*t… So working late night and week end didn't let me write blog post… I didn't have the time to continue working on Jocs/Pocs either…


But I really intend to fix this by publishing new article soon. I have several topics in mind :).



## In the meantime, a new layout for this blog

I can't really say that I changed the design of the blog, but I changed the layout to include a right panel. There is also 2 new carew plugin that I wrote myself.
I'll write a simple blog post about each one with a way to install it.

Fyi, the two plugins are:

- [FastNavExtension](https://github.com/bacardi55/carew-plugin-fastnav): A plugin that add link to the previous / next article (see at the bottom of this page for example);
- [BlogRollExtension](https://github.com/bacardi55/carew-plugin-blogroll): A very dumb plugin to create a list of url (as on the top of the right panel). This one is very simple but it was my first carew plugin, I had to start with a easy one :D.



## So a blog post for nothing ?

Unfortunatly yes :-P. This is just an "I'm alive" article to force me to make me live this blog again. And to show you the new layout :).



I'll be back shortly for some technical stuff :).
