This is a quick blog post to say that I love opensource. Everyone who knows me know that I love opensource. I'm using gnu/linux on my laptop and I use linux at work too.

But recently, I've been coding a lot more than before. I don't know why, but my coding motivation has increased a lot.

I started new projects mainly to try new stuff. I starting feeling that there were too much new stuff that made my geek-sense feel interesting so I starting coding again.

I've always love  [symfony](http://symfony.com "symfony") but recently I discover [Silex](http://silex.sension.org "silex") and I really like it.
This post isn't about presenting silex, it's just to thanks the opensource community.

For those who follow my [blog](/2013/02/03/presenting-github-php-dashboard-gpb.html), you know that I started a small project last week : [Github Php dashBoard (GPB)](http://projects.bacardi55.org/gpb/#summary-GPB "Github Php dashBoard")).

When I started this project, the idea was simple. Get the information about my project from github and display it nicely.
I automatically thought about using [Silex](http://silex.sension.org "silex") for the PHP framework. [Twig](http://twig.sensio.org "twig") and [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/ "Twitter Bootstrap") for the view part.

Then I started to look at the [github api](https://api.github.com). And then, in the I found the [php github api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api/ "php github api").

Thanks to all those opensource code, I could do this project in a couple of coding night. When I start being a developer, I always liked to do all by myself. It was fun and I liked doing everything.
Of course, I don't do that at all, neither at work or at home. But the little effort that I had to do to create a really small project is awesome. All I have to do is focus on my PHP code and read the bootstrap documentation to create a really simple design with javascript component. All of that without writing anything but PHP and twig templates.

So to all the contributors of those projects (and to all opensource contributors actually), *THANK YOU*.

This is why all my code are opensource (I actually have to put a LISCENCE file in my repositories some day ^^).
This is actually the main reason why [my blog](http://bacardi55.org "bacardi55's blog") is a static blog, to be able to put it on a [git repository](http://github.com/bacardi55/b-55-log "bacardi55's blog on github").


**Open source, live long and prosper!**
